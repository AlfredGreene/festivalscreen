## Festivalscreen

A open-source infoscreen project. We use Raspberry Pi's to show information to
the attendees of this festival. It runs a PHP script on a central server, or
on the web, that gives fully HTML5-compatible screen that fills the TVs with
content provided by the information-crew.

# Under rebuilding!
We're rebuilding this project next year, as this depended on the Screenly-project,
we would like to make a full package for Raspberry Pis aswell as Android-boards.
Screenly has a lot of restrictions due to their pro-version. We are slowly moving
towards Android-boards, so we can have Web 2.0-support, so we can animate awesome
infoscreens.

We want to make use of the old equipment so the next version will be useable for
both Raspberry Pi aswell as Android-boards, and that will be done with the use
of a central file-server, together with a totally rewritten client-base for
both Raspberry Pi and Android-boards. The information-crew can then upload a
video to the central file-server, that distributes automaticly to our 8GB SD-cards,
and plays accordingly.
